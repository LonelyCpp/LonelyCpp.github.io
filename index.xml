      <description>React Native comes with an awesome Animated API to create smooth and performant animations in your app. It is included with react native which means no dependencies or installations with great cross platform support!
  It&amp;rsquo;s already amazing.
I will be using some simple functions from the Animated API to get you started, after which reading the official documentation here will make much more sense.
 Animated.Value  Holds an animation state.</description>

      <title>Building a UI component library for a product</title>

      <description>Building a component library is a very important milestone in a products life-cycle. It usually isn’t the first thing anyone talks about in the early stages of a product. Startups usually don’t even hire designers, they give that responsibility to front end or mobile developers to come up with a clean user interface owing to the fact that they might have worked with designers in the past and have picked up on some of the UI/UX knowledge.</description>

      <description>Videos are a great way to communicate with your users. In a customer facing ecosystem, youtube plays a part in growth, brand value and engagement. Uploading a video to youtube is easy, cost effective, easy to advertize and might actually make you money in the long run. Youtube is a household name and users are comfortable clicking on a youtube video.
When you&amp;rsquo;re building a mobile app, it just makes sense to include youtube.</description>
