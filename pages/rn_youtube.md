# A better way to integrate youtube into react native

Videos are a great way to communicate with your users. In a customer facing ecosystem, youtube plays a part in growth, brand value and engagement. Uploading a video to youtube is easy, cost effective, easy to advertize and might actually make you money in the long run. Youtube is a household name and users are comfortable clicking on a youtube video.

When you're building a mobile app, it just makes sense to include youtube. You can put in all sorts of videos in your app like -

- promotional videos
- tutorials
- podcasts / periodic content updates

## React Native

The most popular way of embedding a youtube video in react native is to use `react-native-youtube`.

### The Problem

When you're writing apps in react native, one of the most important requirements is to make it look consistent across android and iOS. This will be a problem when you want to embed a youtube video in your app using this library.

It uses the native `YouTube Android Player API` for android and `YoutubePlayer-in-WKWebView` in iOS. The iOS version is the youtube web player and behaves very different to the android implementation. The android player API is a horrible thing to work with. It has a ton of bugs that causes your app to unexpectedly crash.

### The Solution

Using the web player on both android and iOS versions. The [react-native-youtube-iframe](https://github.com/LonelyCpp/react-native-youtube-iframe) library does exactly this.

Its a wrapper around the youtube iframe API used on the web. It uses the community maintained `react-native-webview` to drive everything.

#### Installing

1. `npm install react-native-webview` (you might already have this installed)
2. `npm install react-native-youtube-iframe`
3. `pod install` (in the iOS directory)

Thats it!

#### Code

Lets make an app that has a youtube video on top which the user can play -

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native";
import YoutubePlayer from "react-native-youtube-iframe";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <YoutubePlayer height={250} videoId={"sNhhvQGsMEc"} />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Thats it! It really is that simple and it looks exactly the same on both platforms!

Multiple `<YoutubePlayer />` components with different `videoId`s can be in the same page too!

### MORE

Life needs more challenges. Soo... üçªüçª lets just build a simple functional app that plays a video series and tracks your progress.

The app needs

- a list of videos
- track completion progress
- persist where the user last left the video
- have useful checkpoints in the video to navigate to
